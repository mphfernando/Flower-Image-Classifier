# Flower-Image-Classifier
Flower Image Classifier using Deep Learning   This project implements a deep learning-based image classifier to identify different flower species using a pretrained VGG16 model. The classifier is trained on a dataset of flower images, leveraging transfer learning and PyTorch to fine-tune the model.
